In the big dialogue scenes, you’re conscious of Mr. Cumberbatch riding Shakespeare’s rushing words like a surfboard, as if saving his interior energy for the monologues. In those, he is superb, meticulously tracing lines of thought into revelations that stun, elate, exasperate and sadden him. There’s not a single soliloquy that doesn’t shed fresh insight into how Hamlet thinks. And Ms. Turner stages them beautifully, presenting many in the middle of the action, with Mr. Cumberbatch stepping away as the rest of the cast freezes in tableaus. The effect is of a man separated from reality by his own self-fascinated mind. Hamlet has never seemed so alone, which gives him an added poignancy. This production would benefit greatly, though, if it allowed him to play well with others, too.","type":"string"},"reveal":{"value":"The Greek word logos (word, reckoning or thought) and the Latin word solus (alone) are relevant to the etymology of these terms.","type":"string"},"words":{"value":[{"value":13,"type":"number"},{"value":35,"type":"number"},{"value":59,"type":"number"}],"type":"array"}},"type":"object"},"name":{"value":"TextHighlighting","type":"string"}},"type":"object"}],"type":"array"},"number":{"value":10,"type":"number"}}
