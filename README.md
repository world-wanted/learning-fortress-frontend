# Learning Fortress Frontend

This is a simple VLE project running using a firebase backend. It is designed as a blended learning tool.

## Basic Installation 
1. Make sure you have git, node and npm. We use Visual Studio to edit our code.
2. Clone and install
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Scholar-6/learning-fortress-frontend.git
$ npm install
```
3. Run `ng run debug` for a dev server that reloads on changes to files. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

4. That's it. It is preconfigured to connect to a dummy firebase db in the google cloud. (This database gets restored every so often)

Further information on Firebase stuff can be found in the [firebase/README.md](./firebase/README.md)

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
